# A Very Simple Library For Ternary Diagrams

In this repository, you will find code that I produced while studying Evolutionary Game Theory. I created it with the aim of possibly helping others in search of these kinds of solutions. However, I would like to recommend caution when using these scripts for any important application without thoroughly checking them yourself, as I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the results they provide. Therefore, use them at your own discretion.

## Replicator equations and ternary diagrams
Inside the folder 'Ternary Lib,' you will find a very crude implementation of a library that you can use to plot qualitative trajectory ternary diagrams and, to some degree, solve the replicator equations.
